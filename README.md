# UFO Sightings
## Overview
The puropose of this Module is to create a dynamic webpage, a webpage that utilizes user inputs, by putting JavaScript into an HTML file while simultaneously making use of Bootstrap, CSS, and Chrome Dev tools. For this module, we created a web page displaying UFO data stored as a JavaScript array in both a visually appealling and interactive environment.
## Results

The first screenshot shows the entire web page unfiltered.

The second screenshot shows data filtered by the date "1/4/2010". In order to filter the data, "1/4/2010" was typed into the "Filter Search" area of the web page under "Enter Date".

The third screenshot shows data filtered by the shape "triangle". In order to filter the data, "triangle" was typed into the "Filter Search" area of the web page under "Enter Shape". This process can be continued for the other categories listed in the "Filter Search" area, such as date, city, shape, country, shape, and duration. Filters can be combined for desired results.

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage has to do with the formatting of the typed data stored as a JAvaScript array. THe cases of the letters do not follow standard english rules, thus giving an amateur appearance to the web page. THe data should be pre-cleaned so that it looks more professional. An additional critique of the webpage can be the appearance of the FIlter Search table, which is not standardly organized. Organizing the filter search section into a neat table can add to the visual appeal of the web page.
